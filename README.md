# Whisper
## Whisper is an Android diary app, featuring a novel function - to detect the owner's mood, and reacts with color switching or corresponding responses.

### Current features:
    
    1. Color switching function, under which is a naive Bayesian method.
    2. Archive function to see history diaries and moods.
    3. Responds that are hardcoded.
    
### Features to come:
    
    1. Color switching function with a more mature and precise backend, such as an RNN (Recursive neural network).
    2. Responses that are more intelligent, or say, no hard code, also need an RNN.
    3. Network function (Maybe you can whisper to a friend).
